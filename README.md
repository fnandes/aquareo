# Aquareo

![dashboard](docs/circuit.jpg)

**Aquareo** is an open source software and collection of tutorials that enables to you build your own aquarium controller with Arduino/ESP32/ESP8266 and several cheap electronic components.

### ðŸ©º Monitoring
Check your aquarium temperature, Ph and salinity in any MQTT-compatible home automation solution, like Home Assistant.

### ðŸ“Ÿ Temperature Controller
Automatic turn on/off your header and fan/chiller to keep a stable temperature in your tank.

### ðŸª£ Auto Top-Off
Automatic evaporated water refill. Controls your salinity level to keep a healthy environment.

### ðŸ§ª Dosing automation
Setups the dosing system to perform your dosing/balling.

And more ...

### ðŸ“¦ Fully modular
Despite everything is meant to be built in a single box, you don't need to build all features at one. For instance: you can build only the monitoring component, add the dosing automation later, or use only the auto top-off system.

### ðŸ’¸ Easy and inexpensive to build
Everything is built using some **Arduino compatible** boards and several electronic components. You can easly find everything on Amazon/Ebay/AliExpress. A basic electronic knowledge is required, but all tutorials will be easy to understand with simple diagrams.
